**xfunctiontests** - Java module with set of functions to be used for writing tests:

- assert execution of external commands (output, return code)
- assert content equality of two files or folders (recursively)
- ...

It integrates with [opentest4j](https://github.com/ota4j-team/opentest4j). This allows IDEs or Build Tools (Gradle etc) to understand any assertion failures reported with **xfunctiontests** and process them natively.
